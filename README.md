## Additional Resources

The [THWACK](https://thwack.solarwinds.com) Community is an online community of over 195,000 active users and has been online for over 20 years.  It's free to join and you are awarded THWACK points which you can spend in the [store](https://thwack.com/store) to purchase swag to decorate your office, furnish a (very) small apartment, enhance your table-top role playing game experiences, or groove to your favorite tunes.

Our community members have contributed thousands of extensions for the SolarWinds solutions over the years and they can all be found in the [Content Exchange](https://thwack.com/cx).

Most of the API scripts rely on the SolarWinds Platform's API (formerly 'Orion SDK') and questions are best posed to the [forum](https://thwack.com/orionsdk) dedicated solely to those discussions.  Additionally, there is [SWQL Studio](https://github.com/solarwinds/OrionSDK/releases) which is a navigator and explorer for the API providing an architectural overview of how the entities, verbs, functions, and navigation properties work.

Much of the basic how-to documentation for the SolarWinds Platform API is hosted in the [GitHub respository](https://github.com/solarwinds/OrionSDK/), but questions can be asked in the [Orion SDK Forum](https://thwack.com/orionsdk).

## eBooks

Additionally, there is a upcoming eBook on the SolarWinds Platform API.  Chapter 2 entitled [Modern Problems Require Modern PowerShell for the Modern Orion Platform](https://thwack.solarwinds.com/cfs-filesystemfile/__key/communityserver-components-sitefiles/eBook_5F00_OrionAPI_5F00_PowerShell/Getting-Started-with-the-SolarWinds-Orion-API-_2D00_-Preview-_5B00_Chapter-2_5D00_.pdf) is currently available for download.
