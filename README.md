## Additional Resources

The [THWACK](https://thwack.solarwinds.com) Community is an online community of over 195,000 active users and has been online for over 20 years.  It's free to join and you are awarded THWACK points which you can spend in the [store](https://thwack.com/store) to purchase swag to decorate your office, furnish a small apartment, enhance your table-top role playing game experiences, or groove to your favorite tunes.

Our community members have contributed thousands of extensions for the SolarWinds solutions over the years and they can all be found in the [Content Exchange](https://thwack.com/cx).

Most of the API scripts rely on the SolarWinds Platform's API (formerly 'Orion SDK') and questions are best posed to the [forum](https://thwack.com/orionsdk) dedicated solely to those discussions.  Additionally, there is a helper application known as [SWQL Studio](https://github.com/solarwinds/OrionSDK/releases) which runs on any Windows machine and can be used to explore the entities, verbs, and architecture of the API.
